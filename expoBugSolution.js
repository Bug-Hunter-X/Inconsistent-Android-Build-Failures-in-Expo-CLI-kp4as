The solutions provided here address different potential causes:

**Solution 1 (Updating Dependencies):** Ensure all project dependencies (Expo, React Native, etc.) are up to date. This often resolves compatibility issues.  
```javascript
npm install
```

**Solution 2 (Cleaning the build cache):**  Removing old build artifacts can sometimes fix the problem.
```bash
expo prebuild --clean
expo build:android
```

**Solution 3 (Testing on a different machine):**  If possible, try building the project on a different machine to eliminate environmental factors.

**Solution 4 (Checking the Android SDK Setup):** Verify that the Android SDK is installed correctly and that all necessary tools are available.

**Solution 5 (Creating new project):**  As a last resort, attempt to create a brand-new Expo project. If the issue resolves, then a problem is likely within your project's configuration, rather than with the Expo CLI itself.  Compare the new projects configuration to your existing project for differences. 

**Solution 6 (Check for conflicting packages):** Check `package.json` for any conflicting packages that might cause the build process to fail. Resolve those conflicts and retry the build.

**Important Note:** The exact solution will depend on the specific circumstances.  If none of these solutions resolve the issue, detailed logs from the build process should be examined for any clues about the cause of failure.
