# Inconsistent Android Build Failures in Expo CLI

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo CLI where Android builds fail inconsistently, providing unhelpful error messages.  The issue is reproducible in certain environments but not others, making debugging extremely challenging.

## Reproducing the Issue

1. Clone this repository.
2. Follow the instructions in `expoBug.js` to set up the project.
3. Attempt to build the Android app using the Expo CLI (`expo build:android`).
4. Observe the failure and the unhelpful error message.

## Potential Causes and Workarounds (Solutions are in expoBugSolution.js)

The root cause of this issue is still under investigation.  Potential causes include:

* **Inconsistencies in the build environment:** Differences in the versions of tools (Android SDK, Gradle, Node.js, etc.) may trigger the error.  
* **Issues with the Expo CLI itself:**  Bugs in the CLI could cause these unpredictable failures.
* **Problems with the build process:** The build process might be sensitive to certain aspects of the project setup.

This repo contains potential solutions, although a definitive fix depends on identifying the root cause in a particular scenario.
