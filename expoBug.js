This bug occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app.  The error message is not very informative, often mentioning issues with signing or keystores, even when those are correctly configured. The build process will simply fail without providing a clear reason for the failure.  It might manifest as a generic error or a crash during the build process. This is particularly frustrating as the error is inconsistent and difficult to debug. The app might build successfully on some machines but fail on others with seemingly identical setup.
